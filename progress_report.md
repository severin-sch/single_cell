# Progress report


## Predict on positive part of new data
The models for the differentially expressed subset of the data (ESR1_expression > |0.5|) that are trained on the old dataset are not able to predict the expression of the cells in the new dataset. Exactly the same results occur if we only look at the positively expressed part (ESR1_expression > 0.5).
